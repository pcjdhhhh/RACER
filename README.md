# RACER: Fast and Accurate Time Series Clustering with Random Convolutional Kernels and Ensemble Methods
This repository is the official implementation of [RACER: Fast and Accurate Time Series Clustering with Random Convolutional Kernels and Ensemble Methods] (Under Review)

## The overall execution process of applying the RACER algorithm to time series clustering.

## Main Results: Critical difference diagrams for all methods on UCR archive.

## Main Results: The average ARI value of each algorithm across the datasets used.

## The ARI values on the 117 UCR datasets can be found in the ARI_results.xlsx file.


## Usage

Our code is easy to run; simply execute RACER.py to generate results, which will be stored in output_time.csv.

## The UCR time series.

We directly read the UCR dataset through the interface of the aeon library.

**Requirements**: NumPy, scipy, matplotlib, aeon, sklearn, numba, pandas, pymetis, random, sktime
